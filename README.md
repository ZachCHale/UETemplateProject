This project is meant to be a template for me to use as a base for future projects. The key features I want this template to have are:
- A working settings system with common settings you would expect in most games. 
- A UI System that allows for faster, more manageable, implementation of UI for projects, allowing more focus to go towards the gameplay.
- Main Menu, Pause Menu, and a functional Settings Menu to interact with the implemented settings, all demonstrating use and practicality of the UI System.

This project uses my own UI Navigation System meant to simplify the implementation of navigating game menus, resulting in more manageable code and blueprints whilst also handling both Mouse and Keyboard/Controller input navigation, reducing the overhead needed to manage navigating with different kinds of input. This system is still an early prototype, but I intend to keep building upon it in future releases.

Along with giving me a template to build future projects off of, I am using this project as a way to learn as much as possible about the Engine. Before this project, most of my experience was as a Unity Game Developer. Although this project isn't much of a "Game", I have learned far more than I expected and already feel just as confidant with UE5 as I did with Unity. In some cases I would say I feel more confident mainly due to developing a preference for the engine as I learned how to use some of the features lacking in Unity, one of my favorites being the ability to have code run outside the scope of a level using the GameInstance or a custom SubSystem.
